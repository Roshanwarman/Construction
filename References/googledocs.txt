DELAY PREVENTION

For both construction and manufacturing
Safety Violations
Object detection for respirators, helmets, safety vests, gloves
Guardrails around loose objects like concrete tubes, etc...
Spill detection
Keep spills two feet away from the edge of a trench
Machine guarding {Uncovered : 1. Chips and Sparks, 2. Nip points,3.  Rotating parts}
Guarding of portable circular saw detection
Scaffolding
Will have to be somewhat interactive re: daily scaffold safety check etc. , have people been trained

Fall Prevention
Slippery surfaces
If a person’s head is tilted upwards and they see a full person and there is nothing that crosses through that person (e.g. bar) then flag.
HOW to detect whether something crosses through the person
Hazardous Chemicals - OCR of chemical checked with databank of Safety sheets on site
Forklifts, Cranes - missing rubber on pedals, illegible data plates showing max capacity etc., no seatbelt; Make sure crane range of motion doesn’t extend to a worker’s location (e.g., do not move load above a worker’s head)
Ladders
Ladder 3ft above landing
 ladders tied together/ontop of each other
Clear stairways; no debris on ladder also
Electrical Wires - tied to walls, on a sharp corner, lamps without cover
Prevent ladders or cranes from getting in contact with overhead power lines.
Worn or frayed cables
Loose wires on the ground.
Exposed electrical parts (no cover or not weather safe)
Defective cords and wires; plastic or rubber part is missing
Improper grounding (i.e., plug is broken or wire is broken on extension cord.)
MORE
Store all Video with searchable lookup
Handle Recordable Cases for Hearing Loss
Track when people come and go to help with hour billables and to find individual people if they are needed
Segment out machines and elevators and tell how active they are
Track truck arrival and departure
Vandalism and Theft/ Detection after hours
Detect fires
Detect fights
Lazy worker defined as inactive for > 3 minutes. Worker Activity = Body movement || (Hands moving && !Phone Usage)

Need to consider: If person sees the same scene violation, we can’t count that twice.
Maybe correlate the images of two scenes previously seen so that if they are too similar, do not count?
Maybe keep redundant violations so they attract more attention

Height detection for scaffolds?
Used CNN to detect people walking over structural supports (which one is not supposed to do, but can save time when walking around a construction site) in real time to help prevent injuries. Used region based network for scene labeling (use similar technique to detect people using other equipment such as ladder? Just as they determined people walking over certain structural support, use to detect person using or operating on specific object?)

Uses cnn to detect if there is a guardrail present. Accuracy of 96.5% which is pretty good. Reach out to authors for image data set.
We can now detect if there isn’t any guardrails, but the hard problem is detecting if there should be a guardrail if there isn’t any.

Detects different motions for excavators (digging, hauling swinging). May be useful in characterizing activity of construction machines.
